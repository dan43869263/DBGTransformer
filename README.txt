Integrate Dynamic Bipartite Graph Neural Networks and Temporal Transformer for Bond Prediction (TBGTransformer)AboutThis repository is the PyTorch implementation of ‘Integrate Dynamic Bipartite Graph Neural Networks and Temporal Transformer for Bond Prediction’.Our framework entails multiple components: the bipartite graph representation module of learning node embeddings from the bond and fund interactions and their associated factors; the transformer module to model the temporal interactions; and the self-supervised objective to compensate for label starvation and regularize the node representation learning with graphstructure.InstallationInstall Pytorch Install Pytorch Geometric UsagesTo do the bond prices/yields prediction, run the code:TBGTransformer_train.ipynb
